# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

ApplicationRecord.transaction do
  puts "Destroying tables..."
  # Unnecessary if using `rails db:seed:replant`
  User.destroy_all

  puts "Resetting primary keys..."
  # For easy testing, so that after seeding, the first `User` has `id` of 1
  ApplicationRecord.connection.reset_pk_sequence!("users")

  puts "Creating users..."
  # Create one user with an easy to remember username, email, and password:
  User.create!(
    username: "Demo-lition",
    # email: "demo@user.io",
    password: "password"
  )

  puts "Done!"
